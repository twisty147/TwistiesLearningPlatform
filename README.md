### Justification for Color Scheme
The choice of a blue, grey, and white color scheme for the Twisties Learning Platform is deliberate and serves several purposes:

1. **Professionalism and Trustworthiness**: Blue is often associated with professionalism, trustworthiness, and reliability. By incorporating blue into the color scheme, the platform communicates a sense of credibility and authority in providing STEM education.

2. **Calmness and Serenity**: Blue is also known for its calming and serene qualities. In an educational context, where users may be seeking knowledge and focus, using blue can help create a tranquil and conducive learning environment.

3. **Neutrality and Balance**: Grey is a neutral color that complements blue well. It provides a sense of balance and stability to the color scheme, preventing it from feeling overwhelming or overly vibrant. Grey can also convey sophistication and modernity.

4. **Cleanliness and Simplicity**: White is often associated with cleanliness, simplicity, and purity. By incorporating white into the color scheme, the platform achieves a clean and minimalist aesthetic, which can enhance readability and user experience.

5. **Accessibility and Readability**: Blue and grey are typically high-contrast colors when paired with white, which can improve accessibility and readability, particularly for text and interactive elements.
